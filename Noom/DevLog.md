# Intro

> 6 oct 2024

The goal of this project is to remake a wolfenstein rust clone for the numworks calculator.

At the time i write this, i already started the project.
I cloned the [numworks rust template](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon-sample-app-rust) and copy-pasted the [pr](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon-sample-app-rust/pull/17) for the full API.
I added a few methods for the `Color` struct, to easily manipulate individual colours.
I created a `math.rs` file with some [[Functions Approximations]].
I created a `graphics.rs` file with a buffer object, to be able to draw on this buffer and then draw it on screen.
I created a `doom.rs` file with the game. It currently have a `Player` class and a `Map` class.

I'm trying to implement the [[Grid-aligned Raycast]] for the player view, but it doesn't work.

The ray casting is working. The only issue was... i don't even wanna talk about it.

So the player can see the world, have a sense of depth in this fake 3D.

Time to implement collisions.

# A first play

The collisions were easy to implement, i got them first try !

Now i need to make the game more interesting, by adding some textures.
For that, the map holds a texture object, which holds the texture of each face. Then i just need to get where the ray intersects the wall, and sample the right face.

While sampling the blocks, i noticed something weirdÂ : there is some invisible blocks on edge of the board, when values become negative. I'll have to investigate that.

I started to track [[Progress]].

...And the program crash. I don't know why. I really hope it's not the memory, cause that would be problematic.

# The beginning of the end

The program crash when i sample the faces for texturing.
If it's the memory, i'm fucked up.

It appears to be memory. There is not enough RAM (512 Kb), and i would need to either rewrite this whole thing memory-efficiently, which will be quite hard and long. Or i can grow another project on the ashes of this one, re-using all the libs i written to do something better.
